# BERT-based Text Summarizer

A deep learning project that implements a **BERT-based text summarization system** using **PyTorch** and the **HuggingFace Transformers library**. The model is fine-tuned to generate concise summaries of long textual inputs and is evaluated using **ROUGE metrics**.

## 🧠 Overview

Text summarization is the task of generating a shorter version of a document while preserving its key meaning. This project uses **BERT**, a transformer-based language model, fine-tuned to perform **extractive summarization** with high accuracy.
